### Project summary

TrackMyDegree empowers Concordia students to seamlessly plan their academic journey with an interactive, intuitive
platform that generates course sequences. It allows students to view course prerequisites, core requirements, and
graduation timelines, ensuring they can easily navigate their degree requirements without feeling overwhelmed.

The platform leverages features like document scanning, which automatically populates academic profiles based on
unofficial transcripts and admission letters, which can save a lot of time. It also offers personalized technical
elective recommendations based on students' career goals and academic history, aiding students in making informed
choices. When students change degrees, TrackMyDegree simplifies credit transfer by identifying equivalent courses,
ensuring a smooth transition that maximizes academic credits.

Real-time curriculum updates keep students informed of any changes impacting their degree path, allowing them to adjust
plans proactively to graduate on schedule. As a bonus, future Concordia students from CEGEP or high school can explore
potential degree paths, complete with transfer credit options.

TrackMyDegree targets Concordiaâ€™s students and advisors, starting with the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer
Science, with plans to expand across departments. By streamlining communication and automating advising functions,
TrackMyDegree reduces wait times, empowering advisors to focus on complex issues and enhancing the academic journey for
all. At its core, TrackMyDegree is a student-centric solution, bringing clarity, adaptability, and flexibility to
academic planning and setting a new standard in educational technology.

## Developer Setup Guide

Welcome to the project! This guide will help you get set up to run and develop locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Docker Compose**: To manage multi-container applications.
- **Yarn** and **npm**: This project requires both package managers.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iKozay/TrackMyDegree.git
   cd TrackMyDegree
   ```

2. **Build and Run the Application**:
   Run the following command to start all components:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   This will:

    - Build the docker images
    - Start the frontend, backend and database components.
    - The application should now be running locally.

**Common Issues**
Port already in use:
